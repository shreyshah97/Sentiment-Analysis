Sentiment analysis for tweets after the first GOP debate was done

If the original data was used the positive tweet prediction rate was nearly 45-50% as the tweets were biased, where most of the tweets were negative.

So for further analysis the number of negative tweets were reduced and equalized to the number of positive tweets.

The final results are obtained as follows:
pos_acc 76.74418604651163 %
neg_acc 81.97343453510436 %
